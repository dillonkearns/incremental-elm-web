# Curate notes like a Japanese garden

I visited the Portland Japanese Garden recently. I learned about some of the principles of Japanese gardens there, and it's relevant to the way I want to curate my [[digital-garden]].

## Simplicity

Sometimes leaving space gives what's there more weight. Strong contrast and bold colors can be stunning, but Japanese gardens tend for more subtlety in order to immerse you in the experience without reminding you that it is curated.

For these notes that principle inspired a few changes

- I now list everything as top-level pages
- There is no distinction between tips, articles, learning resources. Instead, they are organized by [[index-pages]] and backreferences
