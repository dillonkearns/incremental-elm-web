description: A short exercise to try or practice a technique with non-production code.
reason: Production code is too complex, with too many variables. Trying out an idea, you don't know if you're having trouble because the technique isn't working, or it's just a difficult part of your production code. Code katas allow you to do a familiar exercise with an unfamiliar technique.
