# Digital Garden

This site is my digitial garden. It's where I develop my thoughts on what I know about Elm.

## What is a digital garden?

There are a lot of digital gardens about digital gardening. So there are a lot of useful resources on the topic!

Some of my takeaways:

- Write note titles as [declarative statements to drive you to clearly develop your ideas](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3KmNj3oKKSTJfqdfSEBzTQiCVGoC4GfK3rYW)
- Digital gardens are emergent - they surprise you with the insights that come from that
- You don't develop thoughts in order to write, you write in order to develop thoughts
