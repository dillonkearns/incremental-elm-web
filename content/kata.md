description: A short exercise to try or practice a technique with non-production code.
reason: Production code is too complex, with too many variables. Trying out an idea, you don't know if you're having trouble because the technique isn't working, or it's just a difficult part of your production code. Code katas allow you to do a familiar exercise with an unfamiliar technique.

# Code Kata

A kind of [[deliberate-practice]] to improve [[tdd]] and other skills. Some examples here: <http://codekata.com/>.

TDD is always at the core, and there are other kinds of [constraint games](https://rchavarria.github.io/blog/2017/07/07/coding-dojo/#constraint-games) you can use to hone other skills.
