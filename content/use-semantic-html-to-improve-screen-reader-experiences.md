# Use semantic HTML to improve screen reader experiences

In general, I'm a fan of the idea that you should [[use-the-platform]]. ARIA tags should be the last resort. Often just using semantic HTML will accomplish the same thing in a more robust and cross-platform way (more consistent across assitive tools, browsers, and OSes).

## What screen readers do with semantic HTML

I find it easier to follow rules when I understand the reason behind them. Following semantic HTML is a simple enough idea, but here is a list of some concrete things that screen readers give you when they see semantic HTML.

- Using divs/spans instead of headings, list items, tables
- [Screen readers use headings and their levels to quickly navigate structure](https://twitter.com/dillontkearns/status/1406989801862045699), much like the equivalent of visually scanning a page for headings
- [Screen readers read out context from the current column's header when navigating table cells](https://youtu.be/hRBSPqxi3Ow?t=2102)
- TODO Checking the window dimensions in JS rather than using media queries
