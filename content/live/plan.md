## Prep

The only prep work involved is

- Pick a nice problem! (see below)
- Try to carve out and clarify the problem itself to make sure it's not a dead-end
- Otherwise, just show up and have fun!

It's okay to have some blemishes, mistakes, not knowing what to do next, etc. That's all part of what makes it useful for viewers. We just don't want to spend time thinking about what the goal of the episode is and making sure the goal is viable. That's what we want to show up with from our prep work.

## What makes for a good episode?

- Narrowly defined, clear problem
- Problem is likely to teach users something that's useful for application-level Elm code (not just packages)
- Interesting problem, but not too complicated to follow

## Why open source?

At least for now, I'm using these live streams as a way to work on open source and let people learn about the process, the projects, and cool techniques that come up while working on them. Open source is neat because it's accessible to anyone! People can open up the code, follow progress on projects, and contribute in all sorts of ways (from sharing feedback or fixing typos to adding major features).

I hope that this series will teach people cool techniques through work on open source, while also making it more accessible.

## Must have technical setup

- Headphones are good (to prevent echo)
- A Skype account and Skype installation on your machine (the morning of the call, I'll give you a Skype link)
- A webcam is good to make the stream more engaging

## Optional technical setup

- A microphone setup is a bonus. I use a [Blue Yeti](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeti/), with a mic stand so that it doesn't absorb shock noise as I type. But that's all optional use whatever you have available! If you're planning on doing a lot of podcasts, live streams, etc., you can always look at nerding out and shelling out some more cash for your setup

## Where will this live?

- I stream episodes at [twitch.tv/dillonkearns](https://twitch.tv/dillonkearns)
- I post episodes afterwards to [youtube.com/dillonkearns](https://www.youtube.com/dillonkearns)
- Upcoming (and previous) episodes are listed at [incrementalelm.com/live](https://incrementalelm.com/live)
